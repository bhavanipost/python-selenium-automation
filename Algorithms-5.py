#1.Selection Sort
# Implement the selection sort algorithm that is sorting in descending order.
#
# Tip: If you'd like to sort the array in descending order using the selection sort algorithm, you'd need to make a small modification to the comparison in the inner loop.
# Instead of looking for the smallest element in the remaining unsorted part of the array, you'd look for the largest element.
